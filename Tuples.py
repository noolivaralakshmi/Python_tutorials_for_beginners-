#the tuples are like the lists , the only difference is that we can not update the tuple
#the tuple have their values seperated by comma


#below are the ways of representing the tuple
t1 = 12,13,4
print(t1)
t2 =(56,78,98,4556)
print(t2)

#we can join the two tuples
t1 = t1 + t2
print(t1)

#we cannot update the tuple values, that is not supported
#t1[2] = 45
